WHAT TO TEST:

1. STUDENT PROFILE PAGE:
   ✅ Check that profile fields are BOLD
   ✅ Verify field names are formatted (e.g., "Job Title" not "JobTitle")
   ✅ Confirm all 4 fields are visible:
      - Education: Bachelor of Science
      - University: MIT
      - Graduation: 2020-01-01
      - Job Title: Software Engineer

2. DOCUMENTS PAGE:
   ✅ Verify 2 documents are listed:
      - test-document.txt
      - test-document-2.txt
   ✅ Click on any document
   ✅ Verify Document Viewer modal opens
   ✅ Test close button (X) and ESC key
   ✅ Check search functionality
   ✅ Test category filter
   ✅ Try different sort options

3. UPLOAD NEW DOCUMENT:
   ✅ Go to Documents page
   ✅ Drag & drop or select a file
   ✅ Upload the file
   ✅ Wait for success message
   ✅ Go back to Profile page
   ✅ VERIFY: Old fields (4) + new fields = cumulative data
   ✅ Go to Documents page
   ✅ VERIFY: 3 documents now listed

4. TEST CUMULATIVE DATA:
   This is the KEY feature - upload multiple documents and verify:
   - First upload: Doc1 fields appear
   - Second upload: Doc1 fields STILL VISIBLE + Doc2 fields added
   - Third upload: All previous fields STILL VISIBLE + Doc3 fields added
   - Data should ACCUMULATE, not REPLACE
