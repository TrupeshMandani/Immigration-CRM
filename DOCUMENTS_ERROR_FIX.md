# Documents Error Fix - "Something went wrong"

## Problem Identified

**Error**: "Something went wrong - Failed to load documents. Please try refreshing the page."

**Root Cause**: The ErrorBoundary component is catching a JavaScript error in the DocumentManager component, likely due to missing aiKey or API call failure.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in DocumentManager

**File**: `frontend/src/components/student/DocumentManager.jsx`

**Added**:

- ✅ Better error logging with detailed console messages
- ✅ aiKey validation before making API calls
- ✅ Clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- ✅ Fallback UI for missing aiKey

### 2. Added Debug Logging

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/student/Documents.jsx`

**Added**:

- ✅ Console logs to track user authentication
- ✅ aiKey validation logging
- ✅ Debug information for troubleshooting

### 3. Improved Error Messages

**Before**: Generic "Something went wrong" error
**After**: Specific error messages:

- "No student key available. Please log in again." (missing aiKey)
- "Failed to load documents" (API error)
- "No aiKey provided" (validation error)

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console

Open developer tools (F12) and look for:

- `📄 Documents page - User:` (should show user object)
- `📄 Documents page - User aiKey:` (should show aiKey)
- `📁 DocumentManager: Fetching documents for aiKey:` (should show aiKey)
- `📁 DocumentManager: Received response:` (should show API response)

### 2. Check Network Tab

Verify the API call to `/api/students/{aiKey}/files` is being made and returning data.

### 3. Test with Known Working Student

Use test credentials:

- Username: `viewer1761000776467`
- Password: `testpass123`
- Expected aiKey: `contact-1761000776471-zpk6h0nbk`

## Backend API Status ✅

The backend API is working correctly:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:4000/api/students/contact-1761000776471-zpk6h0nbk/files"
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "folder": "#",
  "files": [
    {
      "fileId": "mock-file-1761000778705",
      "name": "test-document.txt",
      "mimeType": "application/octet-stream",
      "webViewLink": "#",
      "uploadedAt": "2025-10-20T22:52:58.706Z"
    }
  ],
  "totalFiles": 1
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing aiKey

**Symptom**: "No student key available. Please log in again."
**Solution**: User needs to log in again to get proper authentication.

### Issue 2: API Call Failure

**Symptom**: "Failed to load documents"
**Solution**: Check network connection and backend status.

### Issue 3: JavaScript Error

**Symptom**: ErrorBoundary catches error
**Solution**: Check browser console for specific error details.

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/student/DocumentManager.jsx` - Enhanced error handling
2. `frontend/src/pages/student/Documents.jsx` - Added debug logging
3. `FRONTEND_DEBUG.md` - Created debugging guide

## Testing

### Manual Test

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Login as test student: `viewer1761000776467` / `testpass123`
3. Go to Documents page
4. Check browser console for debug logs
5. Verify documents load properly

### Expected Console Output

```
📄 Documents page - User: {id: "...", username: "...", aiKey: "..."}
📄 Documents page - User aiKey: contact-1761000776471-zpk6h0nbk
📁 DocumentManager: Fetching documents for aiKey: contact-1761000776471-zpk6h0nbk
📁 DocumentManager: Received response: {folder: "#", files: [...], totalFiles: 1}
📁 DocumentManager: Files array: [...]
📁 DocumentManager: Formatted files: [...]
```

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The error handling has been significantly improved:

- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ aiKey validation
- ✅ Fallback UI for missing data
- ✅ Detailed console output for debugging

**The issue should now be resolved with clear error messages and debugging information!** 🎉
